it listed the lines where there was a difference between the two text files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

you could revert to previous versions, branch off at different versions and so on.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: you have logical saves. You can say I changed this and this in the commit. With Docs it gets saved, but explaining is difficult. 
Cons: you do have to do it yourself, it is an overhead.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

different use cases obviously. Git wants you to have logical working versions, while google docs dont care

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
